		<p>I am Subhrajit Chakraborty, who is currently in Class 5A, and my hobby is reading books! I just love to read books because I like the content that books have and how they have big, big chapters. My favourite book is by Micheal Morpurgo. He made a book called: The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips. On first, I thought is was lame and boring; but after I got through 10 pages, then I read some more pages because it is an interesting story on an adventures cat who is lost during the preperations of World War II, and this book was real! so, I read about 50 pages and read 30 pages the next day. And in total, there were 189 pages to read and 189-200 were credits and other details. So after 3 days so, I read the entire book and learned many things of World War II. </p>
